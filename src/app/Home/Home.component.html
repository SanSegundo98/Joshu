        <p class="text-xl font-medium leading-9 text-right text-pretty text-slate-50">Joshu (tries) to help you learn japanese. Making use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic">mnemonics</a>, the objective is to allow you to more easily remember certain words you might struggle to remember. <br><br>
        For example, <strong>何方</strong> would be equal to <i>'Donatello'</i>, like the sculptor (or the turtle, if you prefer). <br><br>
        To start using Joshu, just sign up using the form to the left, or login if you are already signed up, and then add a few cards. <br><br>
        Happy learning. <strong>頑張って！</strong></p>
